## The Song Verses

### English version

1.
```
On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
A Partridge in a Pear Tree.
```

...

12.
```
On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
Twelve drummers drumming,
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords-a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
Eight maids-a-milking,
Seven swans-a-swimming,
Six geese-a-laying,
Five gold rings,
Four calling birds,
Three french hens,
Two turtle doves,
And a partridge in a pear tree.
```

### Australian version

1.
```
On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
A kookaburra in a gum tree.
```

...

12.
```
On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
Twelve possums playing,
Eleven lizards leaping,
Ten wombats washing,
Nine crocs a-snoozing,
Eight dingoes dancing,
Seven emus laying,
Six sharks a-surfing,
Five kangaroos,
Four lyrebirds,
Three wet galahs,
Two snakes on skis,
And a kookaburra in a gum tree.
```
