## Exercise 4: Functional Cohesion üöÄ

### Your Mission
Take your refactoring further by applying **Functional** cohesion principles.

### Key Concepts

**Functional Cohesion:**
> **"Create functions that do one thing well"**
> 
> Pure functions with no side effects, like calculating damage

### Advanced Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Create pure functions** (Functional Cohesion):
   - `calculateDamage(baseAttack)` - returns damage amount
   - Could expand with randomness, critical hits, etc.
   - No side effects - just input ‚Üí output

**Time limit: 15 minutes** ‚è∞
