# Workshop 2 - Cohesion

## Objective
This workshop is designed to give you a better understanding of what various levels of cohesion looks like,
starting from low cohesion moving towards high cohesion.

## Setup
You can use any language you like, however, if you wish to use either ruby or nodejs, running `make` will create
a .tool-versions file and a basic Gemfile/package.json.

## Development Practices During the Workshop
Firstly, the size of this exercises have been designed to allow people to finish them in the alotted time and have time
for discussion after each exercise. Given this we would ask you to *avoid using AI code generation tools*; It trvialises
the exercises and you won't get the full benefit of the workshop.

Lastly, we would like you to TDD the exercise. The first exercise is written in an a-typical way, so we have provided some
pointers in that exercise for people using ruby and nodejs.
